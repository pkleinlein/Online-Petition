# Online-Petition
A simple online petition, that allows a user to register or login, sign to support the cause and edit/update their profile. For this project i used node.js, Express and express-handlebars. Further on i used cookie-session to handle loged in users, csurf to prevent cross-site request forgeries and i used postgres for my SQL database.
